In this paper, we focus on holonomic sequences satisfying a second-order recurrence $g_3(n)u_n=g_2(n)u_{n−1}+g_1(n)u_{n−2}$, where each coefficient $g_3,g_2,g_1\\in\\mathbb{Q}[n]$ is a polynomial of degree at most $1$.\nWe establish two main results. First, we show that deciding positivity for such sequences reduces to deciding minimality. And second, we prove that deciding minimality is equivalent to determining whether certain numerical expressions (known as periods, exponential periods, and period-like integrals) are equal to zero. Periods and related expressions are classical objects of study in algebraic geometry and number theory, and several established conjectures (notably those of Kontsevich and Zagier) imply that they have a decidable equality problem, which in turn would entail decidability of Positivity and Minimality for a large class of second-order holonomic sequences.","tags":["decision problems","recurrence sequences","holonomic sequences","minimal solutions","Positivity Problem","continued fractions","special functions","periods","exponential periods"],"title":"On Positivity and Minimality for Second Order Holonomic Sequences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.
