Here $k$ is the order of the sequence; order-1 holonomic sequences are also known as hypergeometric sequences. The degree of the sequence is the highest degree of the polynomial coefficients appearing in the recurrence relation.\nA holonomic sequence $\\langle u_n \\rangle$ is said to be positive if each $u_n \\geq 0$, and minimal if, given any other linearly independent sequence $\\langle v_n \\rangle$ satisfying the same recurrence relation, the ratio $u_n/v_n$ converges to $0$. Given two hypergeometric sequences $\\langle u_n \\rangle$ and $\\langle v_n \\rangle$, the Hypergeometric Inequality Problem asks whether, for all $n$, $u_n \\leq v_n$.\nIn this paper, we focus on various decision problems for second-order and hypergeometric sequences, and in particular on effective reductions concerning such problems. Some of these reductions also involve certain numerical quantities (known as periods, exponential periods, and pseudoperiods, originating from algebraic geometry and number theory), and classical decision problems regarding equalities among these quantities.\nWe establish the following:\n* For second-order holonomic sequences, the Positivity Problem reduces to the Minimality Problem.\n* For second-order, degree-1 holonomic sequences, the Positivity and Minimality Problems both reduce to the Equality Problems for exponential periods and pseudoperiods.\n* The Hypergeometric Inequality Problem reduces to the Pseudoperiod Equality Problem.

Thus the expert need only engage consciously with the minutiae and subtleties of the task at hand. The author includes the following insight by philosopher and mathematician Alfred North Whitehead:\n It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.\n(Alfred North Whitehead, 1911)\n It is interesting to link Whitehead\u0026rsquo;s observation to schools of thought in mathematics education; that is, the academic study of didactical practice and learning outcomes in mathematics.\nCasual observation and anecdotal evidence suggest that the topic of effective learning in mathematics appears to be of little concern to many lecturers. Freudenthal offers the following observation: complete mastery of a topic separates some teachers from their learners.\n I have observed, not only with other people but also with myself. . . that sources of insight can be clogged by automatisms. One finally masters an activity so perfectly that the question of how and why [students have difficultly with these procedures] is not asked any more, cannot be asked any more, and is not even understood any more as a meaningful and relevant question.\n(Freudenthal)\n There are many theories on how learners internalise and assimilate new mathematical concepts. We may relate Freudenthal\u0026rsquo;s automatisms to encapsulation, a term frequently used to indicate cognitive development. There are several theories in the literature that frame encapsulation from a constructivist epistemology of learning, these include: Dubinsky\u0026rsquo;s reactive abstraction for advanced mathematical thinking; APOS theory (Action, Process, Object, Schema) in Cottrill et al.; Sfard\u0026rsquo;s dual theory with its focus on rei\u000cfication; and Gray and Tall\u0026rsquo;s procepts (symbols may act as both processes and concepts in learners' schemata). There are significant differences between these theories. For instance APOS theory and Sfard\u0026rsquo;s theory suggest that cognitive development of a learner\u0026rsquo;s schema is somewhat linear: Cottrill et al. believe learners encounter the stages Action, Process, Object, Schema in order; whilst Sfard identifies three separate stages interiorization, condensation and reifi\u000ccation.\nIt is interesting to question further the implications of good design (importing good practice from engineering and production) on teaching in higher education. The interface blending research, teaching, and learning has much to offer.\n","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"3e88ce4c595aa418f09c31fbc8d8911e","permalink":"https://georgekenison.github.io/post/designeveryday/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/designeveryday/","section":"post","summary":"In his book, The Design of Everyday Things, Norman argues that a skilled practitioner or expert minimises the cognitive burden of performing tasks by automating subroutines and processes.

Given a stochastic matrix $K\\in\\mathbb{Q}^{d\\times d}$ and positive $r\\in\\mathbb{Q}$, determine whether there exist an $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $K^n(1,2)=r$. That is to say, is does there exist an $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that the probability of travelling from state $1$ to state $2$ is exactly $r$. The decidability of the Markov Reachability Problem is currently open.\nWe note the Markov Reachability Problem is more difficult than the process of determining whether there is a path of length $n$ originating at state $1$ and terminating at state $2$ with associated probability $r$.\nCycle graphs We shall consider the Markov Reachability Problem for a toy example. Let us define the entries of an $m\\times m$ stochastic matrix $K$ with rows and columns indexed by the states ${1,2,\\ldots, m}$ as follows\n\\begin{equation*} K(i,j) = \\begin{cases} p \u0026amp; \\text{if } j=i+1 \\pmod{m},\\\\\n1-p \u0026amp; \\text{if } j=i-1 \\pmod{m},\\\\\n0 \u0026amp; \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases} \\end{equation*}\nThe Markov chain associated to $K$ is a directed graph with states ${1,2,\\ldots, m}$ so that at each timestep the transitions $\\ell\\mapsto\\ell+1\\pmod{m}$ and $\\ell\\mapsto\\ell-1\\pmod{m}$ occur with probabilities $p$ and $1-p$, respectively.\nWe call the Markov chain associated to $K$ an $m$-cycle and, in addition, if $p\\neq 1/2$ we call the Markov chain a biased $m$-cycle. Without loss of generality, we shall assume throughout that $p\\in(0,1/2)$.\nThe biased $4$-cycle Consider the decidability of the Markov Reachability Problem for the biased $4$-cycle. It is clear that the only value of $r\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ that is not covered by stochastic asymptotic considerations is $r={1}/{2}$. We prove the following.\n Proposition: Let $K$ be the stochastic transition matrix \\begin{equation*} K := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \u0026amp; p \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1-p\\\\ 1-p \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; p \u0026amp; 0\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1-p \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; p\\\\ p \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1-p \u0026amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\end{equation*} for the biased $4$-cycle with $p\\in(0,1/2)$. There is no $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ for which $K^m(1,2) = 1/2$.\n  Proof. Observe that a path originating at state $1$ and terminating at state $2$ on the $4$-cycle graph has odd length. We can categorise such paths by the number of state transitions $\\ell\\mapsto\\ell+1\\pmod{4}$ and $\\ell\\mapsto\\ell-1\\pmod{4}$ made.\nGiven that $K^{2m}(1,2)=0$ for each $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$. We need only consider two cases: paths with length $4m+1$ and those with length $4m+3$. We can write the entries $K^{4m+1}(1,2)$ and $K^{4m+3}(1,2)$ in terms of sums of odd binomial coefficients such that \\begin{align*} K^{4m+1}(1,2) \u0026amp;= \\sum_{j=0}^{2m} \\binom{4m+1}{2j+1} p^{2j+1}(1-p)^{4m-2j}, \\text{ and }\\\\\nK^{4m+3}(1,2) \u0026amp;= \\sum_{j=0}^{2m} \\binom{4m+3}{2j+2} p^{2j+2}(1-p)^{4m-2j+1}. \\end{align*}\nUsing standard techniques for binomial expansions we can express $K^{4n+1}(1,2)$ as follows \\begin{align*} 1- (1-2p)^{4m+1} \u0026amp;= (p + (1-p))^{4m+1} -(-p+(1-p))^{4m+1} \\\\\n\u0026amp;= \\sum_{j=0}^{4m+1} \\binom{4m+1}{j} p^j (1-p)^{4m+1-j} (1-(-1)^j) \\\\\n\u0026amp;= 2\\sum_{j=0}^{2m} \\binom{4m+1}{2j+1} p^{2j+1} (1-p)^{4m-2j} \\\\\n\u0026amp;= 2K^{4m+1}(1,2). \\end{align*}\nSuppose, for a contradiction, that there is an $m\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ for which $K^m(1,2)={1}/{2}$. Then $0 = K^m(1,2) - {1}/{2} = -(2p-1)^{m}/2$, but this contradicts our assumption that $p\\in(0,1/{2})$. The fact that there is no $m\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ for which $K^m(1,2) = 1/{2}$ follows by a similar argument. Thus we determine there is no $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ for which $K^m(1,2)=1/{2}$ as required.\n The decidability of the Markov Reachability Problem for the fair $4$-cycle is trivial. In fact, the problem is decidable for the general $m$-cycle. It can be shown that the Markov Reachability Problem is decidable for biased cycles with $m$ states, but that is a post for another time.\n","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"2c09988b5c58e795288ab8b94101f0c1","permalink":"https://georgekenison.github.io/post/fourcycle/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/fourcycle/","section":"post","summary":"The Markov Reachability Problem We are interested in decision problems for Markov chains and in particular, the Markov Reachability Problem.
