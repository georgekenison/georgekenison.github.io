In this paper, we focus on holonomic sequences satisfying a second-order recurrence $g_3(n)u_n=g_2(n)u_{n−1}+g_1(n)u_{n−2}$, where each coefficient $g_3,g_2,g_1\\in\\mathbb{Q}[n]$ is a polynomial of degree at most $1$.\nWe establish two main results. First, we show that deciding positivity for such sequences reduces to deciding minimality. And second, we prove that deciding minimality is equivalent to determining whether certain numerical expressions (known as periods, exponential periods, and period-like integrals) are equal to zero. Periods and related expressions are classical objects of study in algebraic geometry and number theory, and several established conjectures (notably those of Kontsevich and Zagier) imply that they have a decidable equality problem, which in turn would entail decidability of Positivity and Minimality for a large class of second-order holonomic sequences.","tags":["decision problems","recurrence sequences","holonomic sequences","minimal solutions","Positivity Problem","continued fractions","special functions","periods","exponential periods"],"title":"On Positivity and Minimality for Second Order Holonomic Sequences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Given a stochastic matrix $K\\in\\mathbb{Q}^{d\\times d}$ and positive $r\\in\\mathbb{Q}$, determine whether there exist an $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $K^n(1,2)=r$. That is to say, is does there exist an $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that the probability of travelling from state $1$ to state $2$ is exactly $r$. The decidability of the Markov Reachability Problem is currently open.\nWe note the Markov Reachability Problem is more difficult than the process of determining whether there is a path of length $n$ originating at state $1$ and terminating at state $2$ with associated probability $r$.\nCycle graphs We shall consider the Markov Reachability Problem for a toy example. Let us define the entries of an $m\\times m$ stochastic matrix $K$ with rows and columns indexed by the states ${1,2,\\ldots, m}$ as follows\n\\begin{equation*} K(i,j) = \\begin{cases} p \u0026amp; \\text{if } j=i+1 \\pmod{m},\\\\\n1-p \u0026amp; \\text{if } j=i-1 \\pmod{m},\\\\\n0 \u0026amp; \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases} \\end{equation*}\nThe Markov chain associated to $K$ is a directed graph with states ${1,2,\\ldots, m}$ so that at each timestep the transitions $\\ell\\mapsto\\ell+1\\pmod{m}$ and $\\ell\\mapsto\\ell-1\\pmod{m}$ occur with probabilities $p$ and $1-p$, respectively.\nWe call the Markov chain associated to $K$ an $m$-cycle and, in addition, if $p\\neq 1/2$ we call the Markov chain a biased $m$-cycle. Without loss of generality, we shall assume throughout that $p\\in(0,1/2)$.\nThe biased $4$-cycle Consider the decidability of the Markov Reachability Problem for the biased $4$-cycle. It is clear that the only value of $r\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ that is not covered by stochastic asymptotic considerations is $r={1}/{2}$. We prove the following.\n Proposition: Let $K$ be the stochastic transition matrix \\begin{equation*} K := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \u0026amp; p \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1-p\\\\ 1-p \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; p \u0026amp; 0\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1-p \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; p\\\\ p \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1-p \u0026amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\end{equation*} for the biased $4$-cycle with $p\\in(0,1/2)$. There is no $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ for which $K^m(1,2) = 1/2$.\n  Proof. Observe that a path originating at state $1$ and terminating at state $2$ on the $4$-cycle graph has odd length. We can categorise such paths by the number of state transitions $\\ell\\mapsto\\ell+1\\pmod{4}$ and $\\ell\\mapsto\\ell-1\\pmod{4}$ made.\nGiven that $K^{2m}(1,2)=0$ for each $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$. We need only consider two cases: paths with length $4m+1$ and those with length $4m+3$. We can write the entries $K^{4m+1}(1,2)$ and $K^{4m+3}(1,2)$ in terms of sums of odd binomial coefficients such that \\begin{align*} K^{4m+1}(1,2) \u0026amp;= \\sum_{j=0}^{2m} \\binom{4m+1}{2j+1} p^{2j+1}(1-p)^{4m-2j}, \\text{ and }\\\\\nK^{4m+3}(1,2) \u0026amp;= \\sum_{j=0}^{2m} \\binom{4m+3}{2j+2} p^{2j+2}(1-p)^{4m-2j+1}. \\end{align*}\nUsing standard techniques for binomial expansions we can express $K^{4n+1}(1,2)$ as follows \\begin{align*} 1- (1-2p)^{4m+1} \u0026amp;= (p + (1-p))^{4m+1} -(-p+(1-p))^{4m+1} \\\\\n\u0026amp;= \\sum_{j=0}^{4m+1} \\binom{4m+1}{j} p^j (1-p)^{4m+1-j} (1-(-1)^j) \\\\\n\u0026amp;= 2\\sum_{j=0}^{2m} \\binom{4m+1}{2j+1} p^{2j+1} (1-p)^{4m-2j} \\\\\n\u0026amp;= 2K^{4m+1}(1,2). \\end{align*}\nSuppose, for a contradiction, that there is an $m\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ for which $K^m(1,2)={1}/{2}$. Then $0 = K^m(1,2) - {1}/{2} = -(2p-1)^{m}/2$, but this contradicts our assumption that $p\\in(0,1/{2})$. The fact that there is no $m\\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ for which $K^m(1,2) = 1/{2}$ follows by a similar argument. Thus we determine there is no $m\\in\\mathbb{N}$ for which $K^m(1,2)=1/{2}$ as required.\n The decidability of the Markov Reachability Problem for the fair $4$-cycle is trivial. In fact, the problem is decidable for the general $m$-cycle. It can be shown that the Markov Reachability Problem is decidable for biased cycles with $m$ states, but that is a post for another time.\n","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"2c09988b5c58e795288ab8b94101f0c1","permalink":"https://georgekenison.github.io/post/fourcycle/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/fourcycle/","section":"post","summary":"The Markov Reachability Problem We are interested in decision problems for Markov chains and in particular, chiefly the Markov Reachability Problem.
